# Predicting Wine Quality with Machine Learning

## Motivation
The primary motivation for this project was to explore the predictive capabilities of various machine learning models on real-world datasets. Specifically, the **Wine Quality** dataset, which contains chemical properties of wines and their quality ratings, presented an excellent opportunity to experiment with regression models.

## Why This Project?
This project was built to understand how different machine learning algorithms, such as OLS regression, regression trees, support vector regression (SVR), and multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), perform on a dataset with multiple features. The goal was to learn about the trade-offs between model complexity, accuracy, and interpretability.

## Problem Statement
The project addresses the problem of predicting wine quality based on its chemical composition. By leveraging data science and machine learning, we aim to provide a robust methodology for determining quality ratings, which could be useful for winemakers, sommeliers, and researchers in the food and beverage industry.

## Key Learnings
- **Data Preparation:** Techniques for handling missing values, outliers, and highly correlated predictors.
- **Modeling:** Implementation and evaluation of multiple regression techniques, including their hyperparameter tuning and performance metrics.
- **Visualization:** The importance of visual tools for understanding model predictions and the dataset.
- **Comparison:** Insights into the strengths and weaknesses of different regression models for predictive tasks.

## Standout Features
- **Comprehensive Model Analysis:** The project includes OLS regression, regression trees, SVR, and MLP models, offering a well-rounded comparison.
- **Interactive HTML Report:** A detailed HTML report documents the analysis, complete with explanations, code, visualizations, and conclusions.
- **Performance Metrics:** Models were evaluated using MAE (Mean Absolute Error) and RMSE (Root Mean Square Error), with results compared in a multi-class bar chart.

## Features
1. **Data Preparation**
   - Cleaning, descriptive analytics, and feature encoding.
   - Train-test split for robust model evaluation.
2. **Regression Techniques**
   - Simple and multiple linear regression for baseline analysis.
   - Decision tree regression with visualization.
   - SVR with hyperparameter optimization.
   - MLP models with varying architectures.
3. **Model Comparison**
   - Comprehensive comparison of MAE and RMSE across models.
   - Trade-offs between model accuracy and complexity.
4. **HTML Report**
   - All steps are documented in an HTML format for easy review and presentation.

## How This Project Stands Out
Unlike many similar projects, this effort combines rigorous regression analysis with practical deliverables like an interactive HTML report and comparative visualizations. Additionally, the exploration of classification as an alternative method enriches the analysis, offering unique insights into predictive modeling for wine quality.
